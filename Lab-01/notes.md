### Reassessment

- Because, sometimes, things don’t go to plan...
If you don’t manage to submit your work during the trimester 
then you will have opportunities for reassessment
- For this module, the reassessment exercise is to complete the work
that was previously incomplete
- Once you know you are in this position, keep in contact with Rachel to let her know your intention to submit a reassessment
