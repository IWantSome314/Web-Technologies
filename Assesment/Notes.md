## Part 1

For this part of the assignment, you will develop an idea for your group’s fun
website alongside a design and a plan for achieving an implementation of that
design. These will be presented in a single report. You will likely want to
develop a satisfying user experience, and utilise a visually pleasing design, so
consideration of your users’ interactions with the site at this stage can be
useful. The report will be submitted individually, with each team member
giving a summary of the overall website design (for the group) and then
providing specific detail about the feature/functionality they are responsible
for. While the summary of the overall website may be similar to that of your
group members, it should be an individual summary, not a collectively written
summary.
Before you begin, it might be worth doing research into the kinds of features
that other fun sites support or possess, especially related to the
feature/functionality you are individually responsible for. Don’t get too
ambitious though as you have a limited amount of time and might be looking at
what teams of well- resourced professional developers have achieved over a
longer timescale.
Remember that at this stage in your career you are learning about your own
skills, about your ability to turn your ideas into effective implementations, and
about how long it takes you to do these things successfully. As a rule, it is worth
having a simple, core plan containing the essential, minimum viable
functionality. Then you can supplement the core plan with more elaborate
functionality if you make better progress than you expected.
Your deliverable for this part of the assignment is an individual, short, and well
written PDF report. An appropriate target length for this report is a single
document of no more than 8 pages of text in 12pt fontsize (images do not
contribute towards the length guide). The size of the report is a function of your
effort and work and you will not be penalised for going over the guide length by a
reasonable amount. Your report must include the following:
1. A description of the overall site that your group is planning with enough
background context for your reader to understand what you are trying to do.
2. A summary of any background research into other similar sites, or useful
technologies, libraries, or APIs that you have individually investigated with a
description of how this has contributed to your group’s project idea and
design. This can be related to the group’s site as a whole as well as for
the specific feature you are responsible for in the group.
3. A list of the features/functionality in the group’s overall site and some
discussion of why each is included. A clear description and discussion of the
feature/functionality you will be responsible for in the group is required.
4. Site organisation and/or navigation tree diagrams with associated discussion
and explanation of how your group plans to organise the pages that make up
the site and how a user might typically navigate through those pages. Your

diagrams can be combined if that is a useful way to present the organisation
and navigation for your site. These diagrams may be hand-drawn and
scanned/photographed, or created using any image/diagram software as you
think fit. The diagrams and explanation you provide must include the
specific feature/functionality you are responsible for, but they can also
address site as a whole.
5. A sketch/wireframe/low/mid/high-fidelity prototype of an initial user
interface for your group’s site and some commentary on the motivation for
your design, i.e. how does your design address the feature/functionality for
which you are responsible? You only need to include the design of the
features/functionality that you are responsible for, but if you choose to
include design for the whole site make sure you attribute the design to
the correct individuals in your team. If your designs are hand-drawn then
they can be scanned/photographed for inclusion in your report.
6. A project plan that demonstrates how you will organise your effort and time
to achieve your goals. This plan can be presented in any appropriate form,
e.g. a list of dates and tasks, a gantt chart, and/or a narrative description. It
should include your personal plan to complete what you are responsible
and an overall group plan. The group plan can be less detailed, but should
give an indication that as a group you have discussed appropriate target
completion dates for all parts of the project.
7.(Optional) As appropriate: any additional sections that you deem fit to
describe your group’s project, with specific attention paid to the
features/functionality you are responsible for. For example, if you have
decided to implement a particular feature as an extension to the core
requirements then this would be the place to report on it. Similarly if you
intend to save data within the browser, then some description of the kinds of
data that you intend to store, how you will store it, and how it will be
structured, should be reported on.
Your report must be uploaded to Moodle by the deadline of **3PM on Friday 28th
February 2025.**




## Part 2

As a group, you must implement your group’s planned site from part #1 using
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You may use any other technologies such as
libraries, frameworks, third-party APIs, and browser APIs as appropriate.
However, your entire site must be deployed through GitHub pages. When you
have used tools, libraries, or APIs other than pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
written by any members of the group, you must be able to justify why you
used them. Remember that this assignment is evaluating your skills on these
core technologies and that use of readymade code (libraries/frameworks) can
leave you with less opportunity to demonstrate what you can do.
Your deliverables for this part of the assignment are the following:
1. A public deployment of your site using the GitHub pages hosting
feature. (You can choose one member of the group to deploy the full site

on their GitHub pages, but each member should be testing the
features/functionalities they are responsible for using thir own GitHub
pages).
2. A zip archive containing the complete source code and all resources for your
site submitted to Moodle.
3. A short (approximately 4 pages in 12pt fontsize) individual PDF report from
each member of you group that covers the following:
A. Clearly identifies the URL (web address) of your deployed site.
B. Explains the differences between the initial plan as outlined in
part #1 and the final implementation. There is no penalty for
deviating from your group’s initial plan, or your specific plan for
the feature/functionality you are responsible for.
C. Describes any features that you would add or improve to enhance
the project, given more time, and what you now know. You should
focus on the feature(s) you were responsible for in the group.
D. Reflects upon the challenges you faced and achievements you made
during this assignment. Here you can discuss both individual
achievements and challenges you faced as well as reflect on how
the groupwork affected the assessment. This should include what
you learned about how you work in that type of team as well as
what you might have wanted to go more smoothly. While many
future careers will involve individual work, you will also likely be
part of a team where all the individual work comes together to
create a final product. Reflecting on how you work in different
team environments will be useful when you go on to work with
different types of teams and personalities.
4. A short screencast with voice-over of you demonstrating the features of your
site (see the "Demonstration Screencast" section below for more details). Each
member of the team should be demonstrating the feature they were
responsible for. This can be done in many ways, including the group recording
it all together, simply switching the presenter when you demonstrate a new
feature, or individual members of the group recording their portions and then
editing them all together into a single screencast.
A single zipped archive containing your sourcecode, report, and screencast must
be uploaded to Moodle by the deadline. Each member of your group needs to
submit these items. This demonstrates that the group as a whole is working
together, and allows for the individual submission of the report.
The deadline for submitting part #2 of the assignment is 3PM on Monday 28th
April, 2025
