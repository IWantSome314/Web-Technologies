We are planning to make a game website based on a **CYOAG** concept where you can select options for different outcomes including with puzzels. The idea would be we would have a background with buttons on parts of the image that would relate to an item to interact with such as a note on the wall you could click to read a clue, Answer a question or Solve a puzzle. It would be story based on your friend investigated an abandoned building and got trapped inside now you have to go in and navigate your way around and track clues to your friend but you can tell there is something not quite right with the building or what is inside.
