I am very happy with the outcome of our [webpage](https://iwantsome314.github.io/Group46/) and think happy with how we kept the original design we had made. I would say it is good we kept the same design on the backgrounds, style, text as it keeps you more invested on the questions and story rather than different fonts, colours and sizes. As it could lead you to get distracted or feel less immersed. When I came into starting to develop the website and my pages I was worried about my creativity and using JS as its not something i have done much before but i got the hang of it pretty quickly looking at a lot of threads such as [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/getboundingclientrect) and felt very similar to python which i am more experienced in. I found it quite enjoying creating the spot the difference and finding ways to trouble shoot some issues I was having such as finding the correct positions so I created a feature in our js file that will output the coordinates to the console of the image coordinates so i can  see where the x, y and then i set a margin of 25px to give some leeway on clicking the differences. A issue I had as well was with the images being AI Generated there are some issues in it so I feel users may see what they think is a difference but is not which is not very good for user experience. I ended up not going for the Trivia API has mentioned in my first report "Trivia API `https://the-trivia-api.com/`" just due to the questions may not relating to the images or risk of them not making sense.

In Spot the difference it was better than i expected in some aspects but also not as good in some other ways. I say it came out better in some ways just due to my lack of knowledge at the beginning of how to make a spot the difference or even any type of interactive game or website so I have learned a lot about how to work with JS and html it was fascinating to see the progress as i worked along trying to figure out how to even get the positions and be able to specify the locations on the images of the differences.
