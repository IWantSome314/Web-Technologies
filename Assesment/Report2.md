I am very happy with the outcome of our [webpage](https://iwantsome314.github.io/Group46/) and think it was a great achievement to maintain the original design we had envisioned. Keeping the same design for the backgrounds, style, and text was a deliberate choice, as it helps keep users more focused on the questions and story rather than being distracted by inconsistent fonts, coulors, or sizes. This consistency can make the immersion and engagement better for the user. 

When I began developing my pages in the website, I was initially concerned about my creativity and my limited experience with JavaScript. However, I quickly adapted by referring to resources like [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/getboundingclientrect). I found JavaScript to be quite similar to Python, a language I am more familiar with. I particularly enjoyed creating the "Spot the Difference" game and troubleshooting issues, such as determining the correct positions for differences. To address this, I implemented a feature in our JavaScript file that outputs the image coordinates to the console, allowing me to see the x and y positions. I then set a margin of 25px to provide some leeway for users when clicking on the differences. I also used the `getBoundingClientRect()` method to get the position of the image relative to the webpage size. This was a great way to see the coordinates more accurately, and I found it very helpful in determining the correct positions for differences. I also used the `addEventListener` method to add an event listener to each difference, which allowed me to check if the user clicked on the correct area. This was a great way to make the game more interactive.

One challenge I faced was related to the AI-generated images. These images sometimes contained imperfections that users might mistakenly identify as differences, which could negatively impact the user experience which is one of the reasons why I am not a fan of the use of AI as it can sometimes cause more issues and impedes the learning aspect of what you are doing not allowing you to gain understanding of what you are doing or how to do in the future although in this situation it was needed as none of us do graphic design and also are sensitive on time along with our day to day work. Additionally, I decided not to use the Trivia API mentioned in my first report ("Trivia API `https://the-trivia-api.com/`") because the questions might not relate to the images or could risk being confusing.

The "Spot the Difference" game exceeded my expectations in some ways but fell short in others. It surpassed my expectations because I started with very little knowledge of how to create an interactive game or website. Through this project, I learned a great deal about working with JavaScript and HTML. It was fascinating to see my progress as I figured out how to specify the locations of differences on the images. 

The main issue with the game was the cobweb difference, as it covered a large area. At the time, the best solution I could think of was increasing the clickable margin to 25px, hoping it would be sufficient for users to click on the cobweb. If I had more time and knowledge, I would have liked to implement a feature that allowed users to click anywhere within the cobweb area to register it as a difference. This would have significantly improved the user experience. 

another issue i ran into very late into this was during the recording where my page had stopped working. After some investigation and troubleshooting I found one of the users in the team had made some odd changes when adding their work last minute and seemed to written over some of my parts and other persons in the teams work. Which had caused some important parts to stop working. After finding what had i append i had notified the other user who was affected by the change and I was able to easily fix the issue and get the website working again to how it was before. But it was quite infuriating to see the lack of care for other people in the group by making changes like this and I am unsure on why they had written over others peoples work without realising but they had left there work to the very last minute of when we where all planning on finishing.

Overall, I enjoyed learning various aspects of web development, especially JavaScript. This experience has inspired me to continue learning and incorporate web development into my long-term development plan.

For the riddle, I would have liked to make it more interactive, such as requiring users to click on something to enter their answer, similar to how Dylan implemented his password puzzle. His approach was very creative and well-executed. If I had more knowledge of web development, I would have implemented a similar feature for my riddle question. In my first report, I mentioned wanting to create an interactive element, such as a newspaper where users could click on articles to find information that would help them solve the riddle. This remains an idea I would like to explore in the future. I also wanted to add a timer to the game, but I ran out of time. I believe this would have added an extra layer of challenge and excitement for users. 

My biggest drawback in this project was my limited creativity and understanding what I am capable of. I often found myself struggling to come up with ideas for the game and how to implement them. I also had difficulty understanding how to use JavaScript effectively in certain situations or how I wanted to use it, which made it challenging to create the interactive elements I wanted. However, I am proud of what I accomplished and believe that my experience in this project has helped me grow as a developer. I am excited to continue learning and improving my skills in web development.
Looking back I did not implement alot of what i had talked about in my original report but I think it still turned out well and I have alot to still learn in all aspects of web development. I am looking forward to continuing to learn and grow in this field, and I hope to apply what I have learned in future projects.

I would like to thank my group members for their support and collaboration throughout this project. I believe we worked well together and achieved a great result. I am also grateful for the opportunity to learn from this experience and look forward to applying my newfound knowledge in future projects.
